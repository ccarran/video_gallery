                    "Uma to Shika" is the theme song of TBS television drama No Side Manager. The single features two B-side songs: "Spirits of the Sea" (海の幽霊, Umi no Yūrei), used as the theme song of Children of the Sea, and "Deshomasho" (でしょましょ, Probably).<br>
                    The title of the song (馬と鹿- "Uma to shika") stands for a word game by putting apart two kanjis of the word "baka" (馬鹿- "Stupid") with the particle "to" (と- and) to make the phrase horse and deer.

                    The music video for Lemon was filmed in a church and has over 700 million views, making it the most-viewed Japanese music video.<br>
                    The temporary title for Lemon was "Memento." Kenshi said, "I think [the lyrics for the song] came from somewhere in my memory, but I can't really explain it well either." Even when the day before recording, he was still writing the lyrics, the last two sentences "Like one half of a fruit sliced in two, even now, you are my light" suddenly appeared in his brain and he said, "Ahh, so this song really was "Lemon".  He focused on liveliness and freshness of a lemon, giving it an image quite unlike what's typically associated with death. For the song, he wanted to go for a ballad, but didn't consider that a simple ballad was very interesting, and he did not want it to be purely gloomy. As a result, the song is a hybrid of sorts, with sad words over a dancing, skipping rhythm. He made this song while on his nationwide tour, during which his grandfather passed away. Struck with grief over this event, he took longer than usual to complete this song.<br>
                    The cover illustration for Lemon was made by Yonezu himself.
